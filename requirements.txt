# ========================================
# DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS (ChessHacks Platform)
# Optimized for fast builds with uv package installer
# ========================================
#
# For training/development, use: pip install -r requirements-train.txt
#
# Note: Using regular PyTorch (not CPU-only) because platform uses 'uv'
# which doesn't support --extra-index-url the same way as pip
